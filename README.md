React.js and Node.js Web Application
This is a web application built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. The application allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on posts.

Features
User Registration and Login System: Users can create an account by registering with their email and password. The registration form includes validation to ensure the input meets the required criteria. Once registered, users can log in using their credentials.

Post Management:

Create Post: Logged-in users can create new posts by providing a title and content.
Read Post: Users can view existing posts, including the title and content of each post. Posts are displayed in a user-friendly format.
Update Post: Users can edit the title and content of their own posts. The application provides an interface for updating the existing posts.
Delete Post: Users have the ability to delete their posts. Upon confirmation, the selected post will be permanently removed from the system.
Technologies Used

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user and post data.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to handle routing and API requests.
